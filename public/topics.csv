120,Robotic experiments at ISIR,"At ISIR, we explore the frontiers of robotics across disciplines. Our TurtleBot platforms help us study navigation tasks in neuroscience and human-machine interaction. PogoBots enable groundbreaking research in swarm robotics and collective behavior. And with Franka, we investigate manipulation in both social and interactive contexts. Together, these robots are reshaping how we understand intelligent systems."
270,Discovering Paramecia in theoretical neurosciences,"Fascinating results! These paramecia are very simple organisms, only one cell! ...and yet they respond to acidity gradients! We call them the 'swimming neurons', as they swim in this freshwater using tiny beating cilia, and also, they share proteins with neural membranes!"
540,Overcoming the fear of heights with VR in Interaction Human-Machine,"This is Virtual reality, it can be used to train people to acquire new skills. It can also be used as a therapy. For instance, here, the scenario aims at overcoming the fear of heights. The introduction of haptic feedback in virtual reality can have several meanings: providing more realism, providing more user experience. This is my incognito avatar. In this virtual world, I monitor everything at ISIR: doors, printers, food left out overnight. Nothing escapes my surveillance."
780,"Neurosciences, Embodied Memory: How the Body Shapes What We Remember","Behavior is the final output of brain processing and lies at the core of systems neuroscience. In naturalistic contexts, it's continuous-blending motor, cognitive, and perceptual processes. I use generative models to reverse-engineer these dynamics, from mouse locomotion to human reaching. Crucially, the body itself shapes how memories are stored, interpreted, and recalled, grounding cognition in physical experience."
930,Robotic social interaction,"Have you ever heard of... social interaction? Joy. Affection. Anger. At ISIR, researchers have learned to recreate them... artificially. A robotic arm delivers just the right pressure: slow, fast... gentle... or not. Sometimes, we use sound: a whisper that feels like a touch. And of course... all of it is guided by human feedback. Your reactions."
